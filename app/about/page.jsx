          <p>Hi, my name is Kelsey. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
          <p>
            I am a visual artist and a web developer, who is a recent Brooklyn
            transplant. I thrive on being a bridge between creative and digital
            teams, helping translate ideas and goals across disciplines that
            donâ€™t always speak the same language. With a deep understanding and
            genuine interest in both design and development, I bring unique
            value to digital projects.
          </p>
          <h5>My Art side:</h5>
          <p>
            I am a visual artist with a passion for creativity in various forms.
            Holding a Masters in Graphic Arts and Web Design from the
            Minneapolis College of Art & Design, I consider myself a design
            generalist with a wide range of interests across different
            disciplines. Motion design holds a special fascination for me, as
            showcased in some of my earlier{" "}

          <h5>My Technical Side:</h5>
          <p>
            I took my first web development course during art school and I knew
            I wanted to learn more. Web development drew me in because I wanted
            more tools to be able to build out creative digital projects exactly
            how I envisioned them. In 2022 I deepened my technical education
            through completing a full stack software engineer bootcamp. Since
            then, I gained practical experience working as a web developer on a
            small digital production team at an advertising agency in Minnesota.
            I am currently freelancing in web design and development, helping
            clients bring their digital projects to life with creative and
            functional solutions.
